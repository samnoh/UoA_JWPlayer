# UoA JWPlayer

Some people prefer watching recordings online over downloading. 
Unfortunately, JWPlayer for University of Auckland is quite outdated.

I have made some improvements of UX with a really simple Userscript. 

## Why should I use your script?
1. Black background and larger screen to help you focus on your video
2. Auto-play in HD (check web browser settings first), you never need to change video quality settings.
3. Auto-save the last time you watched
4. Enables PiP (Picture in Picture, MacOS only)

## How can I use your script?
1. Go to https://tampermonkey.net
2. Install it
3. Manually copy the codes, create new script and then paste. 
4. OR just click 'RAW' button and add the script
5. Happy Study :smile:
