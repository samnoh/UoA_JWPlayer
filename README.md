# UoA_JWPlayer

Some people prefer watching recordings online over downloading. Unfortunately, JWPlayer for UoA is quite outdated.

I have made some improvements of UX with a really simple Userscript. 

## Why should I use your script?
1. Black background and larger scren to help you focus on your video
2. Auto-play in HD (check web browser settings first)
3. Auto-Save the time you watched
4. Enalbes PiP (MacOS only)

## How can I use your script?
1. Go to https://tampermonkey.net
2. Install it
3.1 Manually copy the codes, create new script and then paste. 
3.2 OR just click 'RAW' button.
4. Happy Study :smile:
