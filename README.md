# UoA_JWPlayer

Some people prefer watching recordings online over downloading. Unfortunately, JWPlayer for UoA is quite outdated.

I have made some improvements of UX with a really simple Userscript. 

## Why should I use your script?
1. Black background and larger scren to help you focus on your video
2. Auto-play in HD (check web browser settings first)
3. Auto-Save the time you watched
4. Enalbes PiP (MacOS only)

## How can I use your script?
1. Go to https://tampermonkey.net
2. Install it
3. Manually copy the codes, create new script and then paste. 
4. OR just click 'RAW' button (recommended, since you can also get updates later)
5. Happy Study :smile:
